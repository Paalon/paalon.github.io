		<h2>Description</h2>
		<section>
			<p>
				varf is essentially my attempt at modding Dvorak. The name is a combination of Dvorak, Whorf and Dwarf,
				which are the layouts it takes most of its inspiration from. It has 10 keys that are the same as Dvorak,
				9 if you go for the alternative punct setup with <code>;</code> on top left pinky.
			</p>
			<p>
				Initially I tried to
				stay as close to Dvorak as possible, but I pretty quickly realised there's not really a lot you can do
				to stay very true to it without creating something that's equally janky. You obviously can't keep the
				vowels as they are and there's sfbs on every single finger on the right hand. This means that in order
				to begin fixing everything that's wrong with Dvorak, you already have to change some 10 keys. At that
				point I just tried keeping the right hand homerow + <code>r</code> and go from there. <code>a</code>
				<code>ui</code> <code>oe</code> keeps at least 2 of the vowels the same so that is what I chose for the
				vowel block, the left index is straight from Whorf.
			</p>
			<p>
				This left the right hand to basically do what I wanted with it, which somehow ended up being far more
				constrained that I expected. If <code>dtb</code> wasn't a thing this layout would probably not exist.
				<code>r</code> was also helpful here because <code>rn</code> is a very comfy slide, there is literally
				no other place it could go. The keys that are in their original Dvorak positions account for about 55%
				of use, which all in all could honestly be worse.
			</p>

		<h2>Thoughts</h2>
		<section>
			<p>
				he layout still has a lot of issues, but it has good sfb and decent dsfb, good rolls and not a lot of very
				weird patterns. <code>snth</code> is a surprisingly nice homerow to have. I like this vowel setup a lot,
				but it depends on the person. <code>i</code> <code>eu</code> <code>oa</code> could have also worked but
				that would have fewer keys in common with Dvorak. If you prefer ring over middle usage though, do
				consider this instead of the default setup.
			</p>
			<p>
				Its main problems however reside in its redirects. A byproduct of having <code>p</code> and <code>g</code> on the
				vowel hand is a bunch of strange redirects in words like <code>against</code> or <code>people</code>.
				This is further exacerbated by the fact these are on inner index which means they also bring a lot of
				lsbs in addition. I did this because I was fixated on keeping nice combinations with <code>ou</code> in
				<code>you</code>, <code>wou</code> and <code>cou</code> but they're really not as important as they were
				in my head at the time. This is not the end of the world, but it could be better. If I'd make this
				layout now I'd probably cycle <code>cygw</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are also a few things on right hand that aren't ideal. To keep <code>ld</code> and <code>bl</code>
				sane I put <code>l</code> on inner index. I really don't think <code>bl</code> is as important nowadays
				and so I'd probably swap <code>lv</code>, but that still leaves <code>br</code>. Minor, but could be
				better of course.
			</p>
			<p>
				All in all though this is a decent layout, and coming from Dvorak myself I liked using it for a while.
				I would however strongly recommend the swaps I talk about here.
